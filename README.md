### What-is-Computer-Science
Computer science is in its core the science and study of computers. I belive computer science to be all these things as well as their applications and learning how computers work. Computer science is not just learnng about computers though, it is also the act of using them I would say that miost of us use computer science every day of our lives, whenever we use a computer, whether we know it or not.Because above all, computer science is a gateway to creativity, so that we may learn how to create and build and contribute with this relatively new medium.
